	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>Hello! My name is Craig Sauers, and welcome to my website. This is
	designed to help me learn Web Development, and act as a hub to keep track
	of all my upcoming projects, updates about my life, and generally anything
	else I feel like, it is my site after all.</p>
	<p class="highlight">This is going to be some more random garbage just for me to testing some stuff.</p>
